### E-Com Tracker
## Description
The Price Tracking Web Application is a full-stack web application designed to help users monitor product prices and receive automated notifications when prices drop. By leveraging web scraping and cron jobs, the application ensures that users stay updated with the latest price changes, enabling them to purchase products at the best possible prices.

The system allows users to select and track products from various online marketplaces. Once a user subscribes to a product, the application continuously monitors its price and automatically sends an email notification whenever a price drop occurs. This eliminates the need for manual tracking and ensures that users never miss a great deal.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Price Alerts via Email
Whenever a price drop is detected, the system automatically sends an email notification to the user.
The email contains details such as the new price, previous price, and product link.
